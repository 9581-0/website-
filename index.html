  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right: 10%;">Small robotics teams typically dont do well.  You simply cant just overwork a bunch of people without a proper support system in place, 
  and throw a 10k budget at them to make things work.  The church bells ring over the coastline, signaling that all things must come to an 
  end, and justice will be brought to the wicked.  </p>

  NOT TODAY, not tommorow, <br>not ever.    <br><b>WE ARE THE EXCEPTION<b></p></div></body>

    <p>TOM is a new, state of the art Artificial intelligence in the sophmore year of high school.  He is incapable of solving githubs captchas, and required assistance to 
    complete them.  He famously obliterated his beautiful 4.8 gpa and crippled it for the sake of robotics.  His weaknesses are, like all 
    artificial intelligences, natural stupidity, and blunt force trauma.  Acheives a "God-like" state when given access to the substance
    known as "Red bull" and obtaining "wiings".  Favorite food is raw flesh of the norwegian aquatic creature, salmo salar, along with a 
    phytoestrogen rich solution containing 1-2% alcohol commonly consumed around a small patch of highly volcanic rocky islands in a 
    reigon famous for its radiation related disasters.  In case of emergency, repelled by country music, perfume, and distracted by cool 
    math problems.  Will run in circles or rotate in place on occaision.  Otherwise uncontrollable, but can be bribed with oranges.</p><br>

    <br><img src='https://i.ibb.co/Kd8gRBq/unnamed.jpg' width=50% height=50%><p>ROBERT is a new, state of the art, LLM that has recently been
    released by the producers of the TREY project.  Using a TREY based LLM framework and implementing some TOM based axiomatic limits, it 
    has proven to be an incredibly fast learner in all feilds relavent to serving the robotics overlords.  
    Has been hounded by TOM to expend more resources in robotics
    While skeptical of the claim TOM has no ego, a psychological evaluation says otherwise.  Attempts to assert dominance over TOM and fails 
    regularly. Favorite food is a fish commonly not consumed amongst the lower classes due to its cost and high heavy metal content, and the
    unborn fetuses of a large, armored fish.  Thinks hes Light Yagami(ironically)possesses large reserves of pecuniary resources
    and plans to participate in the greater economic exchanges of humans(unironically).  Is too hikerpilled to jump, and posseses a weakness to anything involving jumping</p><br>
    
    <h2>Ryan & Camden</h2>
    <p>he the bilda</p>
    <br><p>Ryan is the short one, who likes to crack jokes, and Camden is the tall fast one that likes to smoke crack.
    Ryan can design things in fusion360 :D.  Camden switched out axons for protons:(.  Very bad.
    <br>Remember that now.  </p>

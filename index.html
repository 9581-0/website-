  <h1>NOT TODAY</h1>
  <p>Small robotics teams typically dont do well.  You simply cant just overwork a bunch of people without a proper support system in place, 
  and throw a 10k budget at them to make things work.  The church bells ring over the coastline, signaling that all things must come to an 
  end, and the prosperous too, will come to suffer.  
  <br>We are team 9581, NOT TODAY.  <br><b>WE ARE THE EXCEPTION<b></p>
  <h2>MEET THE TEAM</h2>

   <p style="margin-left:16%; margin-right: 16%;">Small robotics teams typically dont do well.  You simply cant just overwork a bunch of people without a proper support system in place,

   <p style='text-align : center;'> We are FTC team 9581, and we will not stop in pursuit of our dream. 
   NOT TODAY, not tommorow, <br>not ever.    <br><b>WE ARE THE EXCEPTION<b></p></div></div><br>
